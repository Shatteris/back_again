                    <br><b>Just dark.</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Been so for quite the while,<br> So much so that one finds themselfs doubting their eyes are even open... <br> <b>EVEN</b> after confirming this with touch. <br>
                    <br> One would think they'd be dead if it wasn't for their other senses;<br> The harsh and bumpy wall behind one's back that roughly fuses into an equally harsh floor...<br>
                    Said floor that seems to be covered in a thick layer of a...pleasent thin powder. Such powder one's been twindling with their fingers to pass the time.<br>
                    <br>An... <i>apreciated</i> time burner... <br>
                    But it's apreciation stops when said dust enters one's lungs... <br> <i>Making itself known with each breath...</i><br>
                    A constant reminder...<br>
                    <i>Of the passage of time.</i><br>
                    <br> <b>A persistant annoyance.</b><br>

                    <br> <i>Why are we still waiting?</i><br>
                    It's clearly broken, nothing happened! We can't just wait here, hoping this stupid decision turns around.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>Just...<br><b>get up.</b><br>

                <br> It's a Sunday, they may still be asleep. <br> <br> We have a <b>change!</b> <br> We can make sure they'll never find out where we went.<br>

                <br>With our hand against the wall we head to the entrance... <i><b>well the exit now.</b></i>
                <br> It doesn't take long, there isn't that much space in here. <br> Once the wall's surface shows a noticeable change in texture, <b>we stop and give it a slight push on one of it's corners.</b><br>
                <br>And then another push...<br>
                <br>Followed by other two on the opposite corner...<br>
                <br>...and a last one in the middle!<br><br>
                <br>No reaction, <b>none at all...</b><br>

                <br>It's either that or wait for starvation to end us and that's gonna be a <b>loooong</b> wait... <br> Might as well exhaust ourself while we can.<br>

                    <br> Focusing on keeping a constant pressure on the door.<br>

                     <i>Or is it gave out?</i> <b>No matter!</b> <br> With renewed hope we keep pushing! Shifting from a constant push to quick, sudden ones whenever another give makes itself known<br>
                    <br> Slowly the door becomes looser until... <br><b>We suddenly dont feel it's presence anymore...</b> <br> <br>And collapse on the floor at the other side. <br>

                <br>
                    Or maybe it's embarassing because we're leaving after all the drama. <b>Not such a grand departure as we imagined, uh?</b>

                <br> Light is slipping in from the cracked ceiling, gently revealing your surroundings<br>
                <br> Well... there really isn't much. Dirty walls, rusty floor that turns into a rough concrete one; <br>
                <br> Not much to speak of, besides the big faded <b>"A03"</b> letters on a wall <i>next to the room's only door</i> <br>
                <br> <b>And on the opposite corner...</b> the remains of a sink with a mostly intact mirror above it. <br>
                <br> <br>Mind you... said sink's remains which are now serving as <i>a custom coathangar for a bunch of clothes.</i><br>

            <br> Well, <b>with a certain unease.</b> Honestly <br>
            <br> <i>Weird how we didn't feel this when we stripped on the first place...</i><br>
            Well we had other thoughts at the time.<br>
